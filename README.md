## Architecture
The recent study presented in the RVT paper [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50063-x) evaluates the performance of various deep learning models, such as ResNet50 and VGG16, on image classification tasks.

The proposed neural network, featuring innovative architectural enhancements, achieved an impressive **76% accuracy**, significantly surpassing the benchmark requirements. 
Our key contributions of this work areas follows:
1. Developed a deep learning-based model to calculatethe Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) by predicting six key points in the heart from X-ray images, leveraging thepre-trained EfficientNet7b architecture.
2. Integrated a self-attention mechanism into the modelarchitecture to improve the accuracy of key point pre-dictions, enhancing focus on critical image regions.
3. Achieving a prediction accuracy of 86.5%, surpassing-traditional models like EfficientNet7b and demonstrat-ing the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.
